Recipes Repo
============

This repo is my first small project with The Odin Project.

I will be creating a website that has multiple common recipes in it, with links to the _full recipes_ on a separate web page.

I will be demonstrating the following skills I have learned so far:

*   Using terminal commands to create files
*   Using git to manage my version control and commit to GitHub
*   Writing an HTML boilerplate
*   General formatting in HTML
*   Unordered and ordered lists (in recipes)
*   Creating links between pages in my own website
*   Adding images to my website
